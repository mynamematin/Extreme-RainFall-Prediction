# Project-in-Progress
Excited to share my latest project on Extreme Rainfall Prediction using Convolutional Long-Short-Term-Memory Networks with Increased Sea Surface Temperature as a Predictor! As extreme rainfall events have become a growing concern, I aimed to develop a model to accurately predict these events while taking into account the impact of increased sea surface temperature. The results of my study showed that the ConvLSTM networks outperformed traditional LSTM models and provided more accurate predictions. This work highlights the importance of considering the impact of climate change on extreme rainfall events and provides a new approach for predicting these events using cutting-edge deep learning techniques. #ExtremRainfallPrediction #ConvLSTM #SST #DeepLearning #ClimateChange
